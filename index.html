            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>
                This is the academic website of Andrew Crowley, hosted by the
                <a href="https://www.uml.edu/Sciences/computer-science/">UMass Lowell Computer Science
                    Department</a>.<br><br>
                Throughout the 2020 Academic Year, I'll be updating this site in conjunction with my progress in
                <a href="https://www.uml.edu/catalog/courses/comp/4610">GUI Programming I</a>.
                This page will serve as an index to my GUI I assignments, and possibly projects

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I began studying at UMass Lowell in Spring 2014, majoring in Computer Science to pursue a career in
                Software Engineering.
                The profession captivated me as means of interactive representation through expandable, computational
                design.<br><br>
                From August 2018-2019, I worked at <a href="https://www.draper.com/">Draper Laboratory</a> as a DevOps
                engineer, developing a software test interface for the
                <a href="https://www.draper.com/explore-solutions/trident-ii-mark-6-mod-1-guidance-system">Trident II
                    Missile Guidance System</a>.
                I hope to continue my career with Draper upon graduation, someday migrating into the video game
                industry.
