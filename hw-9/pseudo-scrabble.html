    COMP 4610-201 Assignment: Implementing a Bit of Scrabble with Drag-and-Drop
    Created: 12-16-2019
    File Description: Content layer of the Pseudo-Scrabble word game,
    a single-line rendition of Hasbro's Scrabble.

    To begin playing, click the "New Game" button in the upper-right corner of the game area.

    Each round, your goal is to spell a single word across the game board using letter tiles,
    beginning spelling from the Star space. To place a tile onto the board, click and drag the tile into place.
    When a tile is placed, it cannot be removed, so spell wisely!

    To score your word, click the "Score My Word!" button beneath the game board.
    If your word doesn't exist in the English dictionary, you will earn 0 points for the round.
    Otherwise, the word will be scored according to Scrabble scoring: https://scrabble.hasbro.com/en-us/rules.

    Clicking "Score My Word!" begins a new round of Pseudo-Scrabble. Your score is retained across rounds.
    However, game tiles are of limited supply, and replenish only when a new game is started.
    Tile distribution follows the Scrabble standard:
    A-9, B-2, C-2, D-4, E-12, F-2, G-3, H-2, I-9, J-1, K-1, L-4, M-2, N-6, O-8, P-2, Q-1, R-6, S-4, T-6, U-4, V-2,
    W-2, X-1, Y-2, Z-1 and Blanks-2 (https://scrabble.hasbro.com/en-us/faq).


    Scrabble_Pieces_AssociativeArray_Jesse.js implements the ScrabbleTiles associative array,
    utilized in pseudo-scrabble.js for managing tile distribution and word score allotment.
